This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


# PodcastGen

I developed a podcast platform that empowers users to create and publish their own podcasts using AI technology. The website features user authentication for secure login and podcast management, allowing users to generate AI images for their podcast covers or upload their own. Additionally, the platform enables AI voice generation for podcast transcripts in over 10 languages, enhancing accessibility. I utilized free API integrations to facilitate voice and image functionalities and implemented search capabilities with genre-based recommendations for easy content discovery. Users can also listen to and engage with podcasts from other creators, all within an intuitive user interface designed for an exceptional user experience.
